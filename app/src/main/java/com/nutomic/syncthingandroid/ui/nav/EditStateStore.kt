/**
 * Holds per-route draft/edit state OUTSIDE the Navigation 3 entry composition.
 *
 * Why this exists: Navigation 3 (1.1.3) only composes the top entry and
 * disposes entries covered by another route, so any `remember {}` state inside
 * an entry is destroyed when the user navigates deeper (e.g. from a folder or
 * device editor to its custom sync conditions screen) - unsaved edits are lost
 * on return. A plain `rememberSaveable` is not a full fix either: NavDisplay
 * never clears its SaveableStateHolder on pop (verified against the 1.1.3
 * bytecode), so drafts saved by it resurrect when the same route is re-opened
 * after the edit session actually ended.
 *
 * Lifecycle: a state object lives exactly as long as its route is on the back
 * stack. The host activity (MainActivity) watches the stack and calls
 * [retainAll] whenever the set of live keys changes, so finishing an edit
 * session (save, discard, delete) always evicts the draft and the next open
 * starts fresh.
 *
 * The factory is called lazily per key; keys are derived from the route
 * arguments by each screen (see folderEditStateKey / deviceEditStateKey).
